#WARNING! Only for advanzed users, the bad modification of this can cause severe lag problems or bugs.

  # possible methods: ram / cpu
  #
  # RAM: use more ram (recommended if your server has a bad cpu or have tps problems)
  # How it works? When a player join, it creates on ram a inventory only for this player and when
  # player left, it remove it. So each second, if player has inventory opened, this inventory will
  # be updated.
  #
  # CPU: use more cpu (recommended if your server ram is ussed by other plugins or things)
  # How it works? Each time a player click to open the menu, it creates a task for this player. This task
  # will update the inventory every second. The task will be canceled when the player close the menu
