#
#  FeatherBoard 3
#  Runs like a feather on your server
#  (c) Maxim Van de Wynckel
#
# ------------------------------ #

# Permissions: To use the action groups give them the permission
#              featherboard.group.<group>
#              Make sure to remove them from the other groups
#              when giving a new permission.

# Variables: These variables can be used in the TEXT section
#            of both the header as the footer.
#            
#            {PLAYER}       - Player name
#            {PLAYERNICK}   - Player nickname
#            {SERVER}       - Server name
#            {PLAYERCOUNT}  - Server player count
#            {BUNGEECOUNT}  - Bungee network player count
#            5000+ more ... see spigot page

# Formatting: These are formatting tags allowing you to format the animations
#             or placeholders.
#
#             Substring: This allows you to split a word (even a placeholder) in parts
#               example: <substring begin=0 end=3>Hello World</substring> = Hel
#               usage: This can be used to split placeholders when creating a typewriter
#                      or to split the colors in a placeholder.
#
#             Scroll: This creates a scrolling animation of the text inside it. It accepts
#                     two arguments (the length and space between scrolls).
#               example: <scroll width=20 spaces=20>&2This is a &atest</scroll>

# Placeholder settings
placeholder:
  # logs the memory usage of placeholders on startup
  log-memory: false
  # Clear unused placeholders that are not enabled.
  clear-unused: true
  # Config cache only
  # This will only use placeholders in the config
  # HOWEVER: IT WILL BREAK ALL CUSTOM PLACEHOLDERS!
  # IT WILL ALSO PREVENT ANY HOOKS (PlaceholderAPI)
  config-cache: false
  
# Tweaks to increase performance (Use at own risk)
tweaks:
  # This option does not send scoreboard remove packets
  # to the client on quit. This can increase performance on servers
  # where players quit a lot (hubs, ...)
  #
  # Removal of the plugin requires you to manually delete the scoreboard.dat in the worlds
  # /data folder
  #
  # Enabling this can cause the scoreboard not to work anymore. Use at your own risk
  keepScoreboardOnQuit: false
  # Some placeholders have a slow process behind them. Meaning they might contact a database
  # and take a while to 'resolve'. This will never cause lagg since the placeholders are loaded
  # separate from the sending. But can slow down the animation because it has to wait
  # for the placeholder to be loaded. When having multiple lines like a text that shows
  # the information about the placeholders you put below it, this can cause problems.
  # Enabling this will output a message in the console and ingame to operators
  # saying when a placeholder is causing delays.
  detect-placeholderdelay: false
  # Putting this to true will SPAM your console with timings report per placeholder/animation
  # refresh. Used for debugging purposes.
  # This requires detect-placeholderdelay to true
  verbose-placeholder-timings: false
  # Ignore placeholder problems
  # When set to true, the placeholder will not be disabled
  # this also means that no ERRORS will be logged -> no troubleshooting
  ignore-placeholder-problems: false
  
# Toggling allows you to disable the scoreboard
database:
  # If you want the toggle to stay even when your users
  # log off you can enable this. Keep in mind that this requires a
  # MySQL or SQLite database.
  # If you are configuring the plugin for the first time it is advised
  # to stay away from these settings until you managed the scoreboard
  # set up.

# Scoreboard assigning. The boards can be assigned by various ways.
# default the scoreboards will be assigned by permissions.
# You can only have one way of assigning the scoreboards
#
# PERMISSION 	- 	Assign scoreboards based on permissions
#                   This is the default setting (since 2014)
#               	featherboard.group.<scoreboard>
#
# GROUP			-	Assign scoreboards based on Vault groups
#					this means the scoreboard name has to
#					have the name of your Vault group.
#
# WORLD			-	Assign scoreboards based on the world
#					the player is in.
#
# NONE			-	Do no assign scoreboards and just rely on
#					manual assigning (triggers, etc...)

# GUI: This is a feature enabling a GUI to select a specific scoreboard
# The GUI will show all scoreboards you have permission to. It is not very
# configurable in the way you can't control the location or order of the scoreboards
# For a more configurable GUI I recommend DeluxeMenus

# A list of different scoreboards
boards:
  # Default FeatherBoard comes with a board called "default". All players have the permission
  # featherboard.group.default  (by default) meaning all players should see the scoreboard unless
  # the permission is negated.
  #
  # You can create as many boards as you want as long as the name is unique. It is advised to give logical
  # names such as "vip-board", "mcmmo-levelup", ...
  default:
    # Every section here are different lines. The first section will be used as the title
    # the following sections will be used as the lines on the scoreboard (max 15)
    # Just as the scoreboard names you can name these 'lines' whatever you want. But to make
    # things simple I will use logical names such as "title", "spacer", "header", ...
    title:
      # Every line has its own frames. The animation will loop through these frames on intervals
      # that you configure below.
      # Put all your frames under 'text:'. You can make as many lines as you want and use
      # placeholders and preset effects.
      # Keep in mind that there is a limit in line width!
