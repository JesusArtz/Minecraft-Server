## Load the configuration file from Http(s) server (Only "checks.yml"!)

# Log Violations (default: true)

# Warning: If you are using BungeeCord, I recommend setting
# this to FALSE. This will prevent useless log files from
# being stored and using up precious disk space.

# By setting this option to TRUE, you are forcing Matrix to check everyone
# on the server, INCLUDING anyone who has Operator status. By setting this
# option to TRUE you can run the necessary tests without having to remove
# your operator status.
